This plugin converts URLs to audio files (MP3, OGG, WAV) into HTML5 audio with Flash-based player backup + Cache-System support and Shortcode.

== Description ==

This plugins adds possibility to place audio files into posts and pages using the oEmbed technology used by WordPress for other purposes (YouTube videos etc). Audio files are embeded using HTML5 audio tag, with Flash-based backup player for MP3 format for browsers that don't support either HTML5 or MP3 format (Internet Explorer up to version 8.0, Firefox and Opera).

To put audio file into a post, simply enter the URL link to the audio file as separate paragraph. The plugin will convert it into the player on the page. See screenshots.

This is a special version of oEmbed HTML5 Audio: It is completely rewritten to support Cache Systems like WP Super Cache or W3 Total Cache and I've added some new Features.

= Key Features =

- oEmbed support for mp3, ogg and wav audio files
- HTML5 Audio Shortcode (supports this functions: autoplay, loop, preload, controls and flash fallback)
- Easy to use Shortcode-Generator
- Compatible with Cache-Systems like WP Super Cache or W3 Total Cache
- Flash Fallback

Eine deutschsprachige Anleitung zu diesem Plugin ist auf meinem Blog zu finden:
[WordPress und HTML5 Audio Support – Plugin](http://www.webdesign-podcast.de/2013/02/14/wordpress-und-html5-audio-support-plugin/ "WordPress und HTML5 Audio Support – Plugin")

= The new Shortcode: =

I've added a simple Shortcode to give you the full control of your HTML5 Audio:

`[audio id="your-css-id" class="pb-html5-audio-element" mp3="audio.mp3" ogg="audio.ogg" wav="audio.wav" autoplay="on" loop="on" preload="on" controls="on" flash_fallback="on"]`

All Parameters are optional, but you need to specify at least one Audio Source: mp3, ogg or wav.

Defaults:

- id (optional, will be auto generated by the plugin if you not provide an ID)
- class = pb-html5-audio-element
- autoplay = off
- loop = off
- preload = on
- controls = on
- flash_fallback = on

Please note: The Flash Fallback works only with mp3 files!

Since version 2.3 you can use the Generator below your Editor in Posts and Pages.

= Use the Shortcode in your Theme =

If you want to place an Audio-Tag Player in your Theme, you can use the Shortcode via PHP:

`
<?php
echo do_shortcode('[audio mp3="audio.mp3" ogg="audio.ogg" wav="audio.wav" autoplay="on" loop="on" preload="on" controls="on" flash_fallback="on"]');
?>
`

= Tested support in browsers: =

- Google Chrome 14: MP3, OGG, WAV - native HTML5
- Firefox 6: OGG, WAV - native HTML5; MP3 - Flash-based backup player
- Opera 11: OGG, WAV - native HTML5; MP3 - Flash-based backup player
- Internet Explorer 8: MP3 - Flash-based backup player; OGG, WAV - not supported
