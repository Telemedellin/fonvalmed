Turn off comments for all posts and pages with one click.

== Description ==

Many sites get flooded with spam because old posts or pages had comments turned on. You can configure new posts to have comments turned off by default, but there is no easy way to turn off comments on all *existing* posts or pages... until now! There are many plugins that will completely disable all comment functionality globally. These are fine if you want to completely turn off comments, but what if you want to enable comments every now and then, on only a few posts? This plugin closes the comment status on all posts but does not remove any of the core Wordpress functionality.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Turn off comments using the tools in Dashboard > Tools > Turn off all comments
