== Installation ==

<ul>
<li>Install your plugin by uploading it in your Wordpress site or install it directly from the Wordpress Plugin Browser.</li>
<li>Upload your logos to the Custom Post Type and add them to a carousel (category)</li>
<li>Copy the shortcode in your Wordpress site. No id specified will return all logos. You can also use the id 'default' for returning all logos. If you want to display a single carousel category, use the slug as the id. The shortcode looks like this <code>[logo-carousel id=default]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: You can't use a carousel category with a slug called 'default'.</p>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I use the slug 'default' for my carousel? =

Because the slug 'default' is already used for displaying all the logos.

= Which browsers are supported? =

We tested this plugin with: Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10, 11; Chrome; Safari; Firefox; Opera;
The grayscale effect does not work with some versions of Internet Explorer.

= What are the server requirements? =
You need a server running PHP version 5.4 or newer. Older versions are not supported and may cause problems.

= I have problems with adding logo images =
When you are using a theme by TrueThemes or another theme which is not supporting featured images, or handles featured images in another way. You cannot use this plugin.
Please contact your theme developer.

= Why is the shortcode not working in widget areas? =
Add this code to your themes functions.php:
' add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode'); '

= About jQuery =
You need a recent version of jQuery to make things work. Please make sure you are loading jQuery in the header of your theme.
You can activate jQuery from the plugin when your theme or plugins aren't using jQuery already.
When you are not sure your theme / plugins are including jQuery already, you can simply test it by creating a carousel and put it somewhere on your website. If the carousel is working, you don't need to enable jQuery from the plugin.
When you enabled jQuery from the plugin, and the carousel is still not working. Please check your site on Javascript errors or other possible issues in installed themes and plugins.
